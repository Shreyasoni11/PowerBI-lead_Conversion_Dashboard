## Insights



Analyzing the "gender" reveals that there is a higher number of female leads compared to male leads. This indicates that the product or service offered may resonate more with the female candidates. Dashboard further highlights in the "age" field that the age group between 18 to 24 years old represents a significant portion of the leads. Understanding this age and gender group's preferences and behaviors can enable marketing teams to design targeted campaigns to capture their attention and meet their specific needs.


Analyzing the "Number of leads from different cities" reveals that the majority of leads are located in cities across South India. Among the cities in South India, Vishakhapatnam, Hyderabad, and Kochi stand out as having the highest number of leads. These cities likely represent significant opportunities for business growth and market penetration in the region.


Analyzing the "Education of Leads" reveals that Leads with a B.Tech educational background and actively seeking job opportunities are higher than others. These can lead to increase engagement and higher lead conversion rates among this particular audience segment.


Analyzing the "Source of Lead Generation" reveals that leads are generated from various sources. Notably, the data indicates that social media, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and email marketing are the most prominent lead generation channels. By prioritizing these channels, companies can enhance their visibility and reach among potential customers.


"Demo Watched Percentage by Language" data reveals that English and Telugu are the most watched languages for demo sessions. Understanding this preference can guide businesses to focus on creating demo content primarily in these languages to resonate better with the majority of leads.


"Reasons for not watching demo" reveals that a significant reason for lack of interest is financial constraints. Some leads might not be able to afford the product or service, leading to disinterest in watching the demo or considering the offering. Providing promotional offers, discounts, or special pricing for a limited period can entice leads who are interested but hesitant due to affordability concerns. Limited-time promotions can create a sense of urgency and encourage lead conversion.


Another notable reason for lack of interest is the preference for offline classes. This suggests that certain leads may prefer traditional face-to-face learning or engagement methods over online or virtual experiences. 


Actively seeking feedback from leads who expressed lack of interest can provide deeper insights into their pain points and help refine lead engagement strategies accordingly.
